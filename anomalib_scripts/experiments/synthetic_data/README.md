Scratches generation:
Use this mask to add realistic scratches to the indicated metallic blue, matte surface. The scratches should appear 
natural and consistent with everyday wear, varying in length and direction. They should reflect light differently 
than the unscratched areas, highlighting the slightly rough and metallic aspect of the surface. Ensure the blue color 
remains natural but is slightly altered in the scratched areas to show signs of wear.

Paint wear:
Simulate realistic paint wear on the specified surface. Areas of paint wear should appear naturally faded in color than the rest of the surface. Make sure the transitions between painted and unpainted areas are smooth and irregular. Apply paint stripper to the entire area.
